code_library
=============
Javascript function library
-----------------

# About
This is my collection of functions written in a module pattern. I also borrow the underscore/lowdash convention. All functions can be accessed outside the module using _.function_name();

# Npm
code_library is also an npm package that can be added to a project.
Just use ~npm install code_library~
